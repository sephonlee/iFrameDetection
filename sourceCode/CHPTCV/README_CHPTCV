Contents:

demo.m		main file, launch it (and tune its parameter) to compare several procedures considered in the paper on your own data or on simulated data
		Note: our results for the BGH procedure are based on a R program given to us by S. Huet, so it is not included in this package

proc_ERMBM.m	function corresponding to the procedure [ERM,BM]
proc_ERMVF.m	function corresponding to the procedure [ERM,VF]
proc_LOOVF.m	function corresponding to the procedure [LOO,VF]
proc_PML.m	function corresponding to the procedure PML
proc_ZS.m	function corresponding to the procedure ZS

DataGener.m and Regsig_gener.m are subfunctions used for generating synthetic data as in the paper

the other m-files (chpt1xx2VF.m cout_Risque_emp.m eval_histo.m pente.m prgdyn.m) correspond to subfunctions common to several functions proc_XXX.m
